## Features

- **10 algorithms** across sorting, searching, and technique categories
- **Step-by-step execution** — run automatically or advance manually one step at a time (including stepping backward)
- **Live pseudocode + code panel** with line highlighting synced to the current step
- **Multi-language code snippets** — Pseudocode, Python, C++, and Java
- **Sound mode** — optional audio tones that reflect comparisons, swaps, and sorted placements
- **Custom array input** — enter your own comma-separated values
- **Preset cases** — instantly load Best, Average, Worst, and Equal-elements scenarios
- **Speed control** — from Very Slow to Instant
- **Dark / Light theme** toggle
- **Responsive design** — works on desktop and mobile

| Selection Sort | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | ❌ |
| Insertion Sort | O(n) | O(n²) | O(1) | ✅ |
| Merge Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) | ✅ |
| Quick Sort | O(n log n) | O(n log n) / O(n²) | O(log n) | ❌ |
| Counting Sort | O(n+k) | O(n+k) | O(n+k) | ✅ |

### Techniques

## How It Works

Each algorithm is implemented as a JavaScript **generator function** that yields snapshot objects at every meaningful step. A snapshot contains the current array state and highlight metadata (which indices are comparing, swapping, sorted, etc.). The renderer reads these snapshots to paint the bar chart or grid view, and the code panel highlights the corresponding pseudocode line.

This makes stepping forward *and* backward trivial — all snapshots are pre-computed and stored in an array.
