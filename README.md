## 📌 About This Repository

This repository contains all of my frontend web development projects — built hands-on while learning core web technologies. Every project here represents a real concept practiced and shipped, from layout and responsiveness to animations and interactivity.

The goal is simple: **learn by building**, maintain clean code, and keep shipping.
