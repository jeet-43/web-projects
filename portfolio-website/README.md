# Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, skills, and overall growth as a frontend developer.

The goal of this project was not just to create a static site, but to learn by building — iterating on design, improving user experience, and refining code quality over time.

## 🔹 About the Project

- Built completely from scratch
- Focused on clean UI, smooth animations, and responsiveness
- Iteratively improved over the course of **one month**
- Designed to reflect my current skill level and learning mindset

I used online resources, YouTube tutorials (especially **Sheriyans Coding School**), and AI tools as learning and debugging aids — while writing and understanding the code myself.
